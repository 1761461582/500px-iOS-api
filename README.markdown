Trying to write a wrapper for the 500px API in Objective-C to make it easier for other developers to write apps against this awesome service.

Currently a work in progress; this is very early in the development of this project, as it's just something I'm tackling on the side in my spare time. 

## How to use:

Drag this project in as a subproject of whatever you're working on. Add the .a file generated as a library to link against. 

This project requires LLVM 4.0+ and Xcode 4.4+, and is compiled with ARC.
